        <h4>Crosswalk Manifest Demo 4</h4>
        Download app named like "manifestdemo4.apk" from <a href="https://github.com/crosswalk-project/demo-express/releases">https://github.com/crosswalk-project/demo-express/releases</a> (It might be included in .zip files in this page), then install it.<br/>
        This demo shows following features can be configured by manifest.json:
        <ul>
          <li>Icon: A jpg format icon (purple background color)</li>
          <li>Xwalk_version: 1.0.0.0.1</li>
          <li>Orientation: Landscape mode</li>
          <li>Splash Screen: Purple background color</li>
          <li>Splash Screen: Landscape mode</li>
          <li>Splash Screen: Ready when the first visually non-empty paint has occurred</li>
          <li>Display: Minimal-ui provides the end-user with some means to access a minimal set of UI elements for controlling navigation (i.e., back, forward, reload, and perhaps some way of viewing the document's address)</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div data-role="footer" data-position="fixed">

          <li>Display "Splash Screen Landscape" with purple background and landscape screen in Splash Screen</li>
          <li>Display some descriptions about manifest configuration with landscape screen</li>
          <li>Display status bar</li>

        <ul>
          <li>Test values include: jpg format icons, five digits version, landscape orientation, minimal-ui display, first-paint ready_when and landscape</li>
          <li>Minimal-ui: This mode is similar to fullscreen, but provides the end-user with some means to access a minimal set of UI elements for controlling navigation (i.e., back, forward, reload, and perhaps some way of viewing the document's address)</li>
          <li>Xwalk_launch_screen members
            <ul>
